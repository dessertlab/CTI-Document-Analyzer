If any of these new targets fell victim to the phishing lure, it would allow FIN7 to increase their foothold within a victim organization\u2019s network and potentially pivot to new areas.\n The command \u201cgetNK2\u201d is likely named after outlook\u2019s NK2 file, which contains a list of auto-complete addresses for Microsoft Outlook 2007 and 2010. Newer versions of outlook no longer use the NK2 file, so FIN7 has also written functionality to handle newer versions of Outlook within the same \u201cgetNK2\u201d command. The command will execute the JScript function in Figure 3 on the victim system.\n Detection authors must make trade-offs to optimize signature performance; narrow signatures lead to high fidelity detections, but risk missing changes in actor behaviors, meanwhile broader detection patterns provide better coverage, at the risk of more false positives. Combatting a well-resourced and adaptive adversary requires a layered approach of both signature styles.\n FIN7 has demonstrated that they are highly adaptable, evading detection mechanisms while impacting a number of large US retail companies over an extended period of time.",
