During a recent incident response investigation, our team identified new attacks by the financially motivated attack group ITG08, also known as FIN6.\n ITG08 is an organized cybercrime gang that has been active since 2015, mostly targeting point-of-sale (POS) machines in brick-and-mortar retailers and companies in the hospitality sector in the U.S. and Europe. More recently, the group has been observed targeting e-commerce environments by injecting malicious code into online checkout pages of compromised websites \u2014 a technique known as online skimming \u2014 thereby stealing payment card data transmitted to the vendor by unsuspecting customers.\n Based on our investigation and analysis of its adversarial tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), we believe ITG08 is actively attacking multinational organizations, targeting specific employees with spear phishing emails advertising fake job advertisements and repeatedly deploying the More_eggs JScript backdoor malware (aka Terra Loader, SpicyOmelette). This tool, a TTP observed in ITG08 attacks since 2018, is sold on the dark web by an underground malware-as-a-service (MaaS) provider.",

Even within these teams, the cyber criminals appear to be task-oriented meaning that one operator is not responsible for the full lifecycle. The following sections highlight the TTPs seen in a subset of incidents and serve to illustrate the divergence that may occur due to the fact that numerous, disparate actors are involved in different phases of these operations.

Notably, the aforementioned MAZE panel has an option to specify the date on which ransom demands will double, likely to create a sense of urgency to their demands.\n Based on our belief that the MAZE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we anticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will continue to vary somewhat, particularly in terms of the initial intrusion vector.",
