This incident\u2019s targeting of the engineering industry would be inconsistent with that objective. However, we have recently identified multiple targeted Ryuk and LockerGoga ransomware incidents showing ties to FIN6, through both Mandiant incident response investigations and FireEye Intelligence research into threats impacting other organizations. We have traced these intrusions back to July 2018, and they have reportedly cost victims tens of millions of dollars. As the frequency of these intrusions deploying ransomware have increased, the cadence of activity traditionally attributed to FIN6\u2014intrusions targeting point-of-sale (POS) environments, deploying TRINITY malware and sharing other key characteristics\u2014has declined. Given that, FIN6 may have evolved as a whole to focus on these extortive intrusions. However, based on tactical differences between these ransomware incidents and historical FIN6 activity, it is also possible that some FIN6 operators have been carrying out ransomware deployment intrusions independently of the group\u2019s payment card breaches. Which of those scenarios is happening would influence how pressing a threat the group\u2019s card data breach tactics continue to be. Criminal operations and relationships are highly adaptable, so we commonly encounter such attribution challenges in regards to criminal activity. Given that these intrusions have been sustained for almost a year, we expect that continued research into further intrusion attempts may enable us to more fully answer these questions regarding FIN6\u2019s current status.",

Additional information on these actors is available to Mandiant Intelligence subscribers. A panel used to manage victims targeted for MAZE ransomware deployment has a section for affiliate transactions. This activity is consistent with our assessment that MAZE operates under an affiliate model and is not distributed by a single group. Under this business model, ransomware developers will partner with other actors (i.e. affiliates) who are responsible for distributing the malware. In these scenarios, when a victim pays the ransom demand, the ransomware developers receive a commission. Direct affiliates of MAZE ransomware also partner with other actors who perform specific tasks for a percentage of the ransom payment. This includes partners who provide initial access to organizations and pentesters who are responsible for reconnaissance, privilege escalation and lateral movement\u2014each of which who appear to work on a percentage-basis. Notably, in some cases, actors may be hired on a salary basis (vs commission) to perform specific tasks such as determining the victim organization and its annual revenues. This allows for specialization within the cyber criminal ecosystem, ultimately increasing efficiency, while still allowing all parties involved to profit.",
